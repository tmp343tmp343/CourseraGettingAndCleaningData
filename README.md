CourseraGettingAndCleaningData
==============================

## Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. This repo contains two files: run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md. The run_analysis.R file creates a tidy data set by executing the 
following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a final, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The CodeBook.md file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that are performed to clean up the data.
